# Flow Development Workflow Guide

## 🎯 Scenario: Multiple Developers Working on Different Flows

This guide addresses the common scenario where multiple developers are working on different flows within the same Flows solution.

### **Current Situation:**
- **John**: Completed work on Flow 1, ready to push
- **Doe**: Still working on Flow 2, not ready yet
- **Challenge**: Both flows are in the same "flows" solution

## 🔄 **Recommended Workflow**

### **Step 1: John's Process (Flow 1 Complete)**

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/john-flow1-updates
   ```

2. **Export Only Flows Solution**
   - Go to GitHub Actions
   - Run "01-Export Solution From Dev" 
   - Select `flows` as solution
   - Use custom branch name: `feature/john-flow1-updates`

3. **Review Changes**
   - GitHub will create PR automatically
   - Review that only John's flow changes are included
   - If Doe's incomplete changes appear, coordinate to exclude them

4. **Merge When Ready**
   - Once approved, merge to main
   - This triggers automatic deployment via `03-deploy-flows-solution.yml`

### **Step 2: Doe's Process (Flow 2 When Ready)**

1. **Sync with Latest Main**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main  # This includes John's changes
   git checkout -b feature/doe-flow2-updates
   ```

2. **Complete Flow 2 Development**
   - Finish Flow 2 in DEV environment
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Export and Deploy**
   - Run export workflow for `flows` solution
   - Use custom branch name: `feature/doe-flow2-updates`
   - Create PR and merge when ready

## 🛡️ **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

### **Strategy A: Coordinate Development Environment**

**Best Practice**: Developers should coordinate in DEV environment:

```yaml
Development Rules:
1. John works on Flow 1 - saves and publishes when complete
2. Doe works on Flow 2 - keeps as draft until ready
3. Export only captures published flows
4. Incomplete flows remain as drafts
```

### **Strategy B: Use Separate DEV Environments**

If you have multiple DEV environments:

```yaml
Environment Strategy:
- DEV-John: John's development environment
- DEV-Doe: Doe's development environment  
- DEV-Main: Integration environment
```

Update your export workflow to target specific DEV environment:

```yaml
# In 01-export-solutions-from-dev.yml
dev_environment_url:
  description: 'DEV Environment URL (optional - uses default if empty)'
  required: false
  type: string
```

### **Strategy C: Enhanced Export with Flow Filtering**

Create a more granular export process:

```yaml
# New input in export workflow
flows_to_export:
  description: 'Specific flow names to export (comma-separated, optional)'
  required: false
  type: string
```

## 🔧 **Implementation Steps**

### **Immediate Actions for Your Team:**

1. **Document Current Flows**
   ```bash
   # Create flow inventory
   echo "Current Flows in Solution:" > FLOW_INVENTORY.md
   echo "1. CreateContactWhenAccountCreated - Owner: [Assign]" >> FLOW_INVENTORY.md
   echo "2. [Flow Name] - Owner: John" >> FLOW_INVENTORY.md  
   echo "3. [Flow Name] - Owner: Doe" >> FLOW_INVENTORY.md
   ```

2. **Establish Development Rules**
   - Only publish flows when complete and tested
   - Use meaningful flow descriptions
   - Coordinate in team chat before exports

3. **Use Feature Branches**
   - Always use descriptive branch names
   - Include developer name and flow purpose
   - Example: `feature/john-account-automation-flow`

### **Enhanced Workflow (Optional)**

Create flow-specific pipelines for better isolation:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/export-specific-flow.yml
name: Export Specific Flow
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      flow_name:
        description: 'Specific flow to export'
        required: true
        type: string
      developer_name:
        description: 'Developer name'
        required: true
        type: string
```

## 📋 **Development Checklist**

### **Before Starting Flow Development:**
- [ ] Check with team if anyone else is working on flows
- [ ] Create feature branch with descriptive name
- [ ] Document which flow you're working on

### **During Development:**
- [ ] Keep flow as draft until complete
- [ ] Test thoroughly in DEV environment
- [ ] Coordinate with team before major changes

### **Before Export:**
- [ ] Ensure flow is published and tested
- [ ] Verify no conflicts with other developers
- [ ] Use meaningful commit messages

### **After Export:**
- [ ] Review PR for unexpected changes
- [ ] Test in lower environments before production
- [ ] Update team on deployment status

## 🚨 **Emergency Procedures**

### **If Accidental Export Occurs:**

1. **Stop Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Cancel running workflow in GitHub Actions
   # Go to Actions → Cancel running jobs
   ```

2. **Create Hotfix**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b hotfix/remove-incomplete-flow
   # Remove unwanted changes manually
   ```

3. **Coordinate Team**
   - Notify all developers
   - Document what happened
   - Plan resolution steps

## 📞 **Team Communication Template**

```
🔄 Flow Development Status Update

Developer: [Name]
Flow: [Flow Name]  
Status: [In Progress/Testing/Ready for Export]
Estimated Completion: [Date]
Conflicts: [None/See details below]

Notes: [Any special considerations]
```

Use this in your team chat to coordinate development.
