### 3. Solving Team Development Challenges ‚≠ê **NEW**

**Problem**: Multiple developers working on different flows in the same solution
- John completed Flow 1, wants to deploy
- Doe still working on Flow 2, not ready
- Risk of conflicts and blocking each other

**Solution**: Use the new **Individual Flow Export** workflow!

**Quick Start for John & Doe:**
```yaml
# John's Export (Ready to deploy)
Workflow: "03-Export Individual Flow From Dev"
Flow name: CreateContactWhenAccountCreated
Developer: john
Status: ready-for-export
Mode: selective

# Doe's Export (When ready later)  
Workflow: "03-Export Individual Flow From Dev"
Flow name: UpdateCustomerFlow
Developer: doe
Status: ready-for-export
Mode: selective
```

**Benefits:**
‚úÖ **Independent Development** - No blocking between developers  
‚úÖ **Conflict Prevention** - Selective exports reduce merge conflicts  
‚úÖ **Clear Tracking** - Know who's working on what flow  
‚úÖ **Parallel Timelines** - Deploy when ready, not when everyone is ready

2. Configure to trigger on pull requests affecting `solutions/**`
3. Add solution structure validation logic
4. Integrate with solution checker for quality analysis
5. Set up as required status check in branch protection

**Branch Protection Integration:**
- Repository Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add rule for `main`
- Check "Require status checks to pass before merging"  
- Search and select the PR validator check
- Result: PRs cannot be merged until validation passes

### üîí Environment Approval Gates
**Status**: ‚úÖ **CONFIGURED** - GitHub Environments are set up and ready

**Current Environment Setup:**

1. **DEV Environment**
   - **Purpose**: Development work and solution export
   - **Variables**: `DEV_ENVIRONMENT_URL`

### Additional Troubleshooting

#### üîç Environment Issues
**Environment not found:**
- Ensure environment names match exactly (case-sensitive: `TEST`, `PRODUCTION`)
- Check that environments are created in repository settings

**No reviewers assigned:**
- At least one reviewer must be assigned to each environment
- Reviewers must have repository access permissions

**Branch restrictions:**
- Ensure deployment branch (`main`) is allowed in environment settings
- Check that branch protection rules don't conflict

#### üìä Viewing Deployment History
- Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
- Click on any workflow run to see execution details
- Check approval history and reviewer comments
- Download artifacts for detailed logs and reports

#### ‚ö° Performance Issues
**Workflow runs slowly:**
- Check Power Platform environment performance
- Verify network connectivity between GitHub and Power Platform
- Review solution size and complexity

**Solution checker takes long time:**
- Large solutions require more validation time
- Complex customizations increase analysis duration
- Consider breaking large solutions into smaller components

## üéØ Best Practices

### üìã Development Workflow Best Practices

**Reviewer Assignment:**
- **For Basic PRs**: Assign developers and QA team members
- **For Production Releases**: Assign senior developers, DevOps engineers, or release managers
- **Code Owners**: Use CODEOWNERS file for automatic reviewer assignment

**Documentation Standards:**
- Require clear commit messages explaining changes
- Document deployment notes in PR descriptions
- Maintain a deployment log/changelog for major releases
- Include solution checker results review in PR process

**Quality Management:**
- Review solution checker artifacts before merging PRs
- Fix critical and high severity issues before deployment
- Test solutions in DEV environment before export
- Validate customizations don't break existing functionality

### üîí Security Best Practices

**Environment Security:**
- Use least privilege principle for service principal roles
- Regularly rotate client secrets (recommended: every 6 months)
- Monitor workflow runs for suspicious activity
- Use environment-specific secrets for different Power Platform environments

**Access Control:**
- Restrict repository access to authorized team members
- Use branch protection to prevent unauthorized changes
- Implement approval gates for production deployments
- Regular access review and cleanup of inactive users

**Monitoring and Alerts:**
- Set up monitoring for both TEST and PRODUCTION environments
- Configure alerts for deployment failures
- Monitor solution checker results for quality trends
- Track deployment frequency and success rates

### ‚è∞ Operational Best Practices

**Deployment Timing:**
- Schedule PRODUCTION deployments during low-usage periods
- Avoid deployments during business-critical periods
- Consider time zones for global teams
- Plan rollback procedures before major deployments

**Environment Management:**
- Keep DEV, TEST, and PRODUCTION environments in sync for metadata
- Regularly backup production data before deployments
- Test rollback procedures in non-production environments
- Document environment-specific configurations
