# Individual Flow Export Workflow Guide

## 🎯 Purpose

This workflow solves the exact problem John and Doe are facing - **multiple developers working on different flows within the same Flows solution** without stepping on each other's work.

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Key Features:**
✅ **Developer-Specific Exports** - Each developer can export their flow independently  
✅ **Conflict Prevention** - Selective export mode focuses on specific flows  
✅ **Branch Management** - Automatic branch naming with developer identification  
✅ **Status Tracking** - Track flow development status (ready, testing, etc.)  
✅ **Team Coordination** - Built-in coordination features and conflict detection  

## 📋 Usage Instructions

### **For John (Flow 1 Complete)**

1. **Navigate to GitHub Actions**
   - Go to your repository → Actions tab
   - Select "03-Export Individual Flow From Dev"

2. **Configure Export Settings:**
   ```yaml
   Flow name: CreateContactWhenAccountCreated
   Developer name: john
   Story ID: TASK-123 (optional)
   Flow status: ready-for-export
   Export mode: selective
   Custom branch name: (leave empty for auto-generation)
   ```

3. **Run Workflow:**
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - The system will:
     - Create branch: `feature/TASK-123-john-createcontactwhenaccountcreated-20250905-1430`
     - Export only the flows solution
     - Analyze flow changes
     - Create PR with detailed analysis

4. **Review PR:**
   - Check that only John's flow changes are included
   - Review the generated analysis report
   - Merge when satisfied

### **For Doe (Flow 2 When Ready)**

1. **Wait for John's Changes to Merge** (optional but recommended)
2. **Sync with Latest:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Export Doe's Flow:**
   ```yaml
   Flow name: [Doe's Flow Name]
   Developer name: doe
   Story ID: STORY-456
   Flow status: ready-for-export
   Export mode: selective
   ```

4. **Independent Deployment:**
   - Doe's changes will be based on the latest main (including John's changes)
   - No conflicts because they worked on different flows

## 🛠️ Workflow Features

### **Pre-Export Validation:**
- ✅ Validates export request
- ✅ Generates descriptive branch names
- ✅ Checks flow status compatibility

### **Smart Export Process:**
- 🔍 Lists available flows in DEV environment
- 🎯 Focuses on specified flow (selective mode)
- 📊 Analyzes changes and potential conflicts
- 📄 Generates detailed analysis report

### **Quality Gates:**
- ✅ Solution checker validation
- ✅ Dependency analysis
- ✅ Conflict detection
- ✅ Comprehensive reporting

### **Team Coordination:**
- 📋 Clear branch naming conventions
- 📊 Status tracking (ready, testing, etc.)
- 📝 Detailed analysis reports
- 🔔 Team notification summaries

## 📊 Export Modes

### **Selective Mode (Recommended):**
```yaml
export_mode: selective
```
- Exports entire flows solution but focuses analysis on specific flow
- Maintains solution integrity
- Highlights target flow changes
- Reduces merge conflicts

### **Full Solution Mode:**
```yaml
export_mode: full-solution
```
- Standard full solution export
- Use when multiple flows are modified
- More comprehensive but higher conflict risk

## 🌿 Branch Naming Convention

**Auto-Generated Format:**
```
feature/[STORY-ID]-[DEVELOPER]-[FLOW-NAME]-[TIMESTAMP]
```

**Examples:**
- `feature/TASK-123-john-createcontactwhenaccountcreated-20250905-1430`
- `feature/STORY-456-doe-updatecustomerflow-20250905-1530`
- `feature/john-accountautomation-20250905-1630` (no story ID)

## 📄 Analysis Reports

Each export generates a detailed analysis report including:

### **Export Details:**
- Flow name and developer
- Export mode and status
- Branch name and timestamp

### **Solution Analysis:**
- Solution version information
- File counts and targets
- Dependency information

### **Team Coordination:**
- Story/task tracking
- Status documentation
- Conflict warnings

### **Next Steps:**
- PR review checklist
- Testing recommendations
- Team coordination notes

## 🔄 Team Workflow Example

### **Scenario: John & Doe Working Simultaneously**

1. **John starts Flow 1:**
   ```bash
   # John works in DEV environment on Flow 1
   # Keeps flow as draft until complete
   ```

2. **Doe starts Flow 2:**
   ```bash
   # Doe works in DEV environment on Flow 2  
   # Also keeps flow as draft until complete
   ```

3. **John completes first:**
   ```yaml
   # John exports with status: ready-for-export
   Flow: CreateContactWhenAccountCreated
   Developer: john
   Status: ready-for-export
   ```

4. **John's PR merges:**
   ```bash
   # John's changes are now in main branch
   # Deployment pipeline handles TEST/PROD deployment
   ```

5. **Doe completes later:**
   ```yaml
   # Doe exports after John's merge
   Flow: UpdateCustomerFlow
   Developer: doe  
   Status: ready-for-export
   ```

6. **Independent deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Doe's branch is based on latest main (includes John's changes)
   # No conflicts because different flows
   # Clean deployment path
   ```

## 🚨 Conflict Resolution

### **If Conflicts Occur:**

1. **Detection:**
   - Workflow analysis will flag potential conflicts
   - PR review will show unexpected changes

2. **Resolution Options:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Coordinate with team
   # - Discuss changes in team chat
   # - Decide on merge order
   
   # Option 2: Rebase approach
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout feature/your-branch
   git rebase main
   # Resolve conflicts and continue
   ```

3. **Prevention:**
   - Use descriptive flow names
   - Keep flows as drafts until complete
   - Coordinate development in team channels
   - Use the analysis reports to review changes
