  - Manual trigger available
  - Deploys to BUILD ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí PRODUCTION

- **`03-deploy-coffeeshop-solution.yml`** - Deploy Coffee Shop Solution  
  - Auto-triggers when `solutions/coffeeshop/**` changes
  - Manual trigger available
  - Deploys to BUILD ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí PRODUCTION

### 3. Shared Components
- **`shared-deployment-pipeline.yml`** - Reusable deployment logic
  - Called by deployment workflows
  - Handles BUILD ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí PRODUCTION pipeline with quality gates
  - **Three solution checker validation points**
  - Contains environment URLs and deployment steps

### 4. Validation Workflows
- **`pr-validator.yml`** - PR validation with solution checker
  - Auto-triggers on PRs affecting `solutions/**`
  - Validates solution structure and quality
  - Blocks merge if critical/high issues found

## üîÑ Complete Workflow Process

```
1. Developer makes changes in DEV environment
   ‚Üì
2. Run "01-export-solutions.yml" ‚Üí Select solution ‚Üí Export + Validate
   ‚Üì  
3. Review validation results and merge PR
   ‚Üì
4. Auto-trigger "02-deploy-travel-solution.yml" OR "03-deploy-coffeeshop-solution.yml"

5. Solution deploys through BUILD ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí PRODUCTION
```

## üéØ File Naming Convention

- **`01-`** prefix for export/source workflows
- **`02-`** prefix for primary deployment workflows  
- **`03-`** prefix for secondary deployment workflows
- **`shared-`** prefix for reusable workflows
- Descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose

## üìÅ Quick Reference

| Workflow | Purpose | Trigger |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `01-export-solutions.yml` | Export from DEV + Solution Checker | Manual (dropdown) |
| `02-deploy-travel-solution.yml` | Deploy travel solution with quality gates | Auto on path change + Manual |
| `03-deploy-coffeeshop-solution.yml` | Deploy coffeeshop solution with quality gates | Auto on path change + Manual |
| `shared-deployment-pipeline.yml` | Reusable deployment logic with 3 quality gates | Called by other workflows |
| `pr-validator.yml` | PR validation with solution checker | Auto on PRs affecting solutions/ |

This structure makes it immediately clear what each workflow does and in what order they typically execute! üéâ
