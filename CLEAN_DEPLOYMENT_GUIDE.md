# Clean Solution Deployment

This repository uses **dedicated workflow files** for each solution, making deployments simple and transparent.

## 🎯 Workflow Files

### 1. `deploy-travelsolution.yml`
- **Purpose**: Deploy Travel Solution to TEST → PRODUCTION
- **Triggers**: 
  - Manual dispatch
  - Push to main when `solutions/travelsolution/**` changes
  - Release creation

### 2. `deploy-coffeeshop.yml` 
- **Purpose**: Deploy Coffee Shop Solution to TEST → PRODUCTION
- **Triggers**:
  - Manual dispatch  
  - Push to main when `solutions/coffeeshop/**` changes

## 🚀 How It Works

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
1. Export solution using "Export Power Platform Solution" workflow
   ↓
2. Create PR with solution changes
   ↓  
3. Merge PR to main branch
   ↓
4. Appropriate deployment workflow triggers automatically
   ↓
5. Solution deploys: BUILD → TEST → PRODUCTION
   (With solution checker validation at each stage)
```

## 🔍 Quality Gates

Each deployment includes **three solution checker validation points**:

1. **Convert-to-Managed**: Validates solution during packaging
2. **Deploy-to-Test**: Validates before TEST environment deployment  
3. **Release-to-Production**: Final validation before PRODUCTION deployment

### Quality Gate Benefits:
✅ **Early Detection**: Issues caught before reaching environments  
✅ **Continuous Validation**: Solutions checked at every deployment stage  
✅ **Artifact Storage**: Validation results saved for review (30-day retention)  
✅ **Automated Quality**: No manual validation steps required

### Manual Deployment
```bash
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Deploy Travel Solution" or "Deploy Coffee Shop Solution"  
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Solution deploys immediately
```

## 📁 Path Monitoring

Each workflow monitors specific paths:

- **Travel Solution**: `solutions/travelsolution/**`
- **Coffee Shop**: `solutions/coffeeshop/**`

When you export and merge changes to these paths, only the relevant solution deploys.

## ✅ Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Crystal Clear**: Each workflow file has one job - deploy one solution  
✅ **Simple Logic**: No complex detection or conditional logic  
✅ **Easy Debugging**: Clear logs showing exactly which solution is deploying  
✅ **Independent**: Solutions deploy independently without affecting each other  
✅ **Maintainable**: Easy to add new solutions by copying a workflow file  
✅ **Predictable**: Always know which workflow runs for which solution  

## 📊 Workflow Comparison

| Approach | Complexity | Clarity | Maintainability |
|----------|------------|---------|-----------------|
| **One workflow with detection** | High ❌ | Low ❌ | Hard ❌ |
| **Dedicated workflows** | Low ✅ | High ✅ | Easy ✅ |

## 🔧 Adding New Solutions

To add a new solution (e.g., `inventory`):

1. **Copy existing workflow**:
   ```bash
   cp deploy-travelsolution.yml deploy-inventory.yml
   ```

2. **Update the workflow**:
   ```yaml
   name: Deploy Inventory Solution
   paths: 
     - 'solutions/inventory/**'
   solution_name: inventory
   ```

3. **Done!** New solution has its own dedicated deployment pipeline.

## 🎯 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Update Travel Solution
```bash
# Export travelsolution → changes in solutions/travelsolution/
# Merge PR → deploy-travelsolution.yml triggers
# ✅ Only travelsolution deploys
```

### Scenario 2: Update Coffee Shop Solution  
```bash
# Export coffeeshop → changes in solutions/coffeeshop/
# Merge PR → deploy-coffeeshop.yml triggers  
# ✅ Only coffeeshop deploys
```

### Scenario 3: Update Both Solutions
```bash
# Export both solutions → changes in both folders
# Merge PR → BOTH workflows trigger independently
# ✅ Both solutions deploy in parallel
```

## 🔍 Current Workflow Files

```
.github/workflows/
├── export-power-platform-solution.yml   # Export solutions with custom branch naming
├── deploy-travelsolution.yml           # Deploy travel solution
├── deploy-coffeeshop.yml               # Deploy coffee shop solution  
├── shared-deployment-pipeline.yml      # Reusable deployment logic with quality gates
└── pr-validator.yml                    # PR validation with solution checker
```

### Shared Deployment Pipeline
The `shared-deployment-pipeline.yml` provides reusable deployment logic featuring:
- **Convert-to-Managed**: Packages unmanaged solutions as managed solutions
- **Deploy-to-Test**: Deploys to TEST environment with approval gates
- **Release-to-Production**: Deploys to PRODUCTION environment with approval gates
- **Solution Checker Integration**: Validates solutions at all three stages
- **Artifact Management**: Stores validation results and deployment logs

This approach follows the **Single Responsibility Principle** - each workflow has one clear job! 🎉
