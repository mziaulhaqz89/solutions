## 🔄 Complete Workflow Process

### **Step 1: Planning Phase**

1. **Team Coordination:**
   ```
   📋 Core Component Development Plan
   
   John: Account entity customizations (ENTITY-001)
   Doe: Contact entity relationships (ENTITY-002) 
   Alice: Student registration forms (FORM-101)
   Bob: Course approval workflow (WORKFLOW-201)
   
   Dependencies: John's Account changes needed before Doe's Contact work
   Timeline: John (Week 1), Doe (Week 2), Alice & Bob (parallel)
   ```

2. **Component Assignment:**
   - Assign specific components to developers
   - Document dependencies between components
   - Plan development timeline

### **Step 2: Development Phase**

1. **Individual Development:**
   - Each developer works on their assigned component in DEV
   - Keep components in draft/development state until ready
   - Test component functionality thoroughly

2. **Component Testing:**
   - Test component in isolation
   - Verify dependencies work correctly
   - Check integration points

### **Step 3: Export Phase**

1. **Navigate to GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to repository → Actions tab
   - Select **"04-Export Individual Core Component From Dev"**

2. **Configure Export:**
   ```yaml
   Component name: Account
   Component type: entity
   Developer name: john
   Story ID: ENTITY-001
   Component status: ready-for-export
   Export mode: selective
   Custom branch name: (optional)
   ```

3. **Run Export:**
   - Workflow analyzes component and dependencies
   - Creates comprehensive analysis report
   - Generates PR with component-focused changes

### **Step 4: Review Phase**

1. **PR Review:**
   - Focus on your specific component changes
   - Review generated analysis report
   - Check for unintended changes to other components

2. **Dependency Check:**
   - Verify component dependencies are intact
   - Check relationship impacts (especially for entities)
   - Test integration points

### **Step 5: Deployment Phase**

1. **Merge When Ready:**
   - Independent merging per component
   - Automatic deployment via existing pipeline
   - Quality gates validate each deployment
