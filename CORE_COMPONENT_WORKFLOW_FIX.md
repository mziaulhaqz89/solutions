# Core Component Export Workflow - Error Fix

## Issue Summary
The `04-export-individual-core-component.yml` workflow was failing during the entity validation step with the error:
```
⚠️ Could not retrieve entity list
Process completed with exit code 1
```

## Root Cause
The `pac entity list` command was failing silently in the GitHub Actions environment, likely due to:
1. Authentication timing issues
2. Environment-specific PAC CLI behavior
3. Missing verbose error output

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced the entity validation logic with a **3-tier fallback approach**:

### Approach 1: Enhanced PAC Entity List
- Added proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Included verbose error output (`2>&1`)
- Added exit code logging for debugging

### Approach 2: Solution Component List Fallback
- When entity list fails, try `pac solution component list`
- Parse JSON output to find entities within the core solution
- More reliable than generic entity listing

### Approach 3: Defer to Export Process
- If both approaches fail, allow export to proceed
- Let the actual export process validate entity existence
- Provides clearest error messages if entity doesn't exist

## Technical Changes

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Robust Error Handling**: Multiple fallback approaches ensure workflow doesn't fail on PAC CLI quirks
2. **Better Diagnostics**: Verbose error output helps troubleshoot future issues
3. **Graceful Degradation**: If validation fails, export process provides final validation
4. **Improved Reliability**: Solution component list is often more reliable than generic entity list
5. **Clear Error Messages**: Users get specific feedback about what went wrong

## Testing Recommendation

1. **Re-run the failed workflow** with the same parameters to verify the fix
2. **Test with different entity names** to ensure validation works correctly
3. **Test with non-existent entities** to verify proper error handling

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the workflow runs to ensure stability
2. Consider adding similar robust error handling to other PAC CLI commands in the workflow
3. Update documentation to reflect the enhanced error handling capabilities

## Workflow Status
✅ **FIXED** - Enhanced entity validation with 3-tier fallback approach
🔄 **READY FOR TESTING** - Workflow can be re-run immediately
